# leaflet-challenge

Get your dataset. To do so, follow these steps:
The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed Links to an external site. page and choose a dataset to visualize. 
Import and visualize the data by doing the following:
Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
